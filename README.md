This project is a clustering analysis on a dataset containing information on several wine varietals. The data was scaled, principal component analysis was conducted, and two clustering techniques were applied in order to cluster these wines. 
K Means clustering and Agglomerative Clustering methods were used in order to group the wines. The characteristics of the ensuing groups were then analyzed to build profiles of each of the three wine groups. Descriptions of these 
subsets are included in the .inpyb document.
